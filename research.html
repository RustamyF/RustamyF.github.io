	I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at Lehigh University, where I work at ATLSS Engineering Research Center. My research is on the topic of Probabilistic Resilience Assessment of Interdependent Systems <a href="http://www.praisys.org/">(PRAISYS)</a> , advised by Prof. <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/richard-sause">Richard Sause</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.lehigh.edu/~pab409/">Paolo Bocchini</a>. [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frustamy">My Curriculum Vitae</a>]<br>
	My research is part of a large collaborative project named Probabilistic Resilience Assessment of Interdependent System (PRAISys). This project involves student and professors from Civil Engineering, System Engineering, Economics, and Urban Planning and Policy Making. The goal of PRAISys project is establish a framework to determine the resilience of interdependent infrastructure systems for extreme events under uncertainty. PRAYSys will help in management and design of new generation of resilient infrastructure system to extreme events. The PRAISys platform includes five main computational steps focusing on transportation, power and communication systems. The role of my research is to contribute on substation resilience assessment of power system to the extreme events as part of this project. <br>
	I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from the Department of Civil Engineering in Kabul University. My undergraduate research advisor is Professor Halim Halim.<br>
