			<h1> Hazards Analyses on Substations </h1>
			There are different reasons for the power outages, however, a report by the US Department of energy cites weather related outages as the leading cause followed by the aging infrastructure, earthquakes, floods and potential cyber-attacks (DOE, 2016). This section will study three types of the natural hazard based on their potential for disrupting the power grid: Seismic, wind, and flood. 
			<h2> 1. Siesmic Hazards </h2>
			Earthquakes are amongst some of the most devastating natural hazards. Majority of US cities in the western US and some parts of central and eastern US are vulnerable to earthquake hazard as shown in Figure ‎2 1 (USGS, 2016). In previous earthquakes, components of transmission substations have suffered damages that have led to large disruption of power to communities. The damages sustained by electrical substations from large earthquakes in California between the 1970s and mid-1990s provided much of the motivation for the seismic design standard IEEE-693, 2005. Transmission substation components are more vulnerable because of the need for larger clearance from ground (for electrical safety), large weights and the use of brittle porcelain components for electrical insulation.

			Fragility curves in this study are developed using ground motions obtained from PEER database (https://peer.berkeley.edu/peer-strong-ground-motion-databases) for general scenario fragility curves, and simulated ground motions using CENA models for site specific fragility curves. The simulated ground motions are transferred to the ground surface in site class A and site class D using DEEPSOIL software (Figure ‎2 6). DEEPSOIL uses the soil column above bedrock and amplifies the ground motion to the ground surface (Hashash, 2019). Figure ‎2 7 shows median values of ground motions amplified to the ground surface for a soil column with Vs=465m/s, H= 30m and a soil column with Vs=465m/s, H= 80 m using the A04 model.

			<h2> 1. Hurricane Hazards </h2>
			<br>
			Circulating weather systems over the ocean waters, also called tropical cyclones, are divided into three categories: tropical depression (maximum sustained winds ≤ 38 mph), tropical storm (maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) and hurricanes (maximum sustained winds ≥ 74 mph) (NOAA, 2016). On average US coasts are hit by five hurricanes in a typical 3-year period, from which two are category 3 or above (NOAA, 2016). The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale divides the hurricane into five categories based on their 1- minute sustained wind speed, which is the measured wind speed at a height of 33 ft. for 10 minutes, and then taking the average. Table ‎2 3 shows the range of these five categories and the frequency of their occurrence in the US between 1851 and 2015 (Jarrell et al., 2001)
