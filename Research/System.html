			<h1> Substation System Reliability </h1>
			Reliability of substation as a system depends upon reliability of individual components (disconnect switches, circuit breakers 
			and transformers) within the substation and the nature of redundancies present in the system. The loss of functionality in a 
			substation after a major earthquake could disrupt services and cause great loss to the communities (Song, 2004). It is of great
			importance to assess the reliability of electrical substation systems to natural hazards and develop efficient methods to 
			upgrade their reliability. In this study, components are defined to make significant contributions to system failure probability.
			<br>
			<br>
			The substation configurations are selected based on the voltage level, simplicity of design, maintenance, 
			feasibility of expansion and economical installation and operational cost (Nack, 2005). A substation system is a 
			combination of series and parallel components acting to increase redundancies in the substation. Mathematically speaking, 
			failure of a series system is the union of failure probabilities of each component in the system. For a parallel system, 
			it is characterized by intersection of its components failure probabilities.
