			<h1> Substation Component Fragilities </h1>
			Substations are also used as interconnection between two different transmission systems operating at different voltages. 
			A typical substation layout is shown in Figure ‎1 3 and contains the following main components.
			1.	Transformers which change the voltage level from high to low or vice versa.
			2.	Circuit breakers which interrupt a circuit when a short circuit condition or current overload condition occurs (to protect the other equipment in the network).
			3.	Disconnect switches which control the flow of electricity and allow components of a substation to be isolated from the circuits in the substation for maintenance purposes.

			<h2> 1. Disconnect Switch </h2>
			Disconnect switches are important components of transmission substations. They are used to control and regulate 
			the flow of electricity between the other components within the substation and are also used to isolate the substation
			components for maintenance. In a typical substation, disconnect switches are used before and after each important piece
			of equipment. Figure ‎2 9 shows a three phase disconnect switch in a substation belonging to a utility company in the 
			Northeast US. Disconnect switches are made of the switch element and the support structure. A switch usually contains 
			two or three insulators, double channel beam that supports the insulators, the switch-blade, and high voltage bus and 
			or flexible cable connected on top of the switch. The support structures are usually made of braced steel frames and are 
			classified by the utilities as low profile (typical height of 12 ft.) or high profile (typical height of 60ft) (Gilani et al., 2006).
